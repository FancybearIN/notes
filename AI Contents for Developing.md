We propose a three-part automation workflow: 
(1) scrape and AI-analyze public endpoints into Google Docs for fast triage, 
(2) run Droid Sentinel static scans and use AI to find exploit chains and validate impact,
(3) run a personal “Hunt” pipeline to continuously enumerate subdomains, CNAMEs, and cloud misconfigs. Combined, these reduce manual effort, prioritize high-impact findings, and create an auditable pipeline from discovery to report-ready evidence.
