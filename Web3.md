Month 1: Foundational knowledge - The Blockchain & EVM

Your goal this month is to establish a strong mental model of blockchain technology and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Your web VAPT experience in understanding system architecture is a major asset here.

- **Week 1: Blockchain basics.** Read the original Bitcoin and Ethereum whitepapers. Watch foundational videos on public-key cryptography, hashing, and the differences between Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).
- **Week 2: EVM deep dive.** Learn about the EVM's stack-based architecture, gas mechanisms, and how storage and memory differ. This will be critical for understanding how smart contract vulnerabilities manifest.
- **Week 3: Learn Solidity.** Focus on the fundamentals of the language: its syntax, data types, inheritance, state variables, and functions. Your coding experience will speed this up, but focus on the "blockchain-native" features.
    - **Resource:** The free Cyfrin Updraft Solidity course is highly recommended for its up-to-date content.
- **Week 4: First smart contract.** Write and deploy a simple smart contract using a browser-based IDE like Remix. Experiment with deploying on a testnet to get a feel for the process. 

Month 2: Development tools and testing environments

Transition from basic understanding to practical application. You will learn the tools that developers use, which auditors also use for analysis.

- **Week 5–6: Development frameworks.** Choose a primary framework to master. Foundry is a popular choice for auditors due to its speed and testing capabilities, including fuzzing. Learn to write tests and deploy contracts within this framework.
    - **Action:** Practice writing unit tests for the contracts you wrote in Month 1.
- **Week 7: Automated auditing tools.** Install and run automated tools like Slither and Mythril on simple, vulnerable contracts. Understand their output, but also recognize their limitations (false positives, logic bugs).
    - **Resource:** Hacken provides a review of automated auditing tools.
- **Week 8: Version control and setup.** Set up a professional GitHub. Mirror your local setup to mirror a real-world development environment. 

Month 3: Vulnerability deep dive & adversarial mindset

This is where your VAPT skills directly transfer. You will focus on common attack patterns and learn to think like a smart contract attacker.

- **Week 9: Common vulnerability patterns.** Study the SWC Registry and the OWASP Smart Contract Top 10. For each vulnerability, read about its root cause and exploitation method.
- **Week 10–11: Hands-on attack practice.** Work through interactive challenges to exploit real-world vulnerabilities in test contracts. This is hands-on practice in a safe environment.
    - **Resources:** OpenZeppelin's Ethernaut and Damn Vulnerable DeFi are the standard for this.
- **Week 12: Study past exploits.** Use databases like Solodit to read post-mortems of major smart contract hacks. Focus on understanding the exploit, the business logic flaw it targeted, and the potential impact. 

Month 4: Competitive auditing and portfolio building

Demonstrate your skills by participating in real-world auditing contests. This is the fastest way to build a public, verifiable track record.

- **Week 13–14: Start with beginner-friendly contests.** Platforms like Cyfrin CodeHawks offer "First Flights" specifically designed for junior auditors. These contests involve smaller, less complex codebases and are a great entry point.
- **Week 15–16: Participate in standard contests.** Move on to more competitive platforms like Code4rena (C4) or Sherlock.
    - **Action:** For every contest, write a detailed report of your findings, even if they are minor. This becomes a core part of your portfolio. 

Month 5: Bug bounties and networking

Expand your reach to bug bounties and engage with the broader security community.

- **Week 17–18: Bug bounty practice.** Start participating in bug bounties on platforms like Immunefi. While the codebase will be larger and more complex, your experience from audit contests will be invaluable.
- **Week 19–20: Networking and engagement.** Join Discord servers for Cyfrin, Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, and the auditing platforms you've used. Contribute to discussions, ask questions, and get to know other auditors.
    - **Action:** Use Twitter and Medium to share your progress, post write-ups of your bug finds, and connect with other researchers. 

Month 6: Resume, interviews, and applications

Package your experience and begin the formal application process.

- **Week 21–22: Polish your portfolio.** Ensure your GitHub is a professional, clean record of your work. Create a polished resume that highlights your VAPT background and newly acquired smart contract security experience.
- **Week 23: Target internships and junior roles.** Actively search and apply for internships and junior security researcher positions at firms like Trail of Bits, Cyfrin, or OpenZeppelin. Frame your experience (e.g., bug bounty wins) as your equivalent of an internship.
- **Week 24: Interview preparation.** Review your foundational knowledge, past bug finds, and explanations of common vulnerabilities. Be prepared to discuss your methodology and problem-solving process. Many companies will test your skills with a practical security challenge during the interview
