Nice — hungry for a $5k+ hit. Love it. Let’s be surgical and opportunistic: you’ve got an old program (last bugs were P4 and P1) and some Tier-0/1 targets (Okta, identity endpoints, APIs, file shares, mobile apps). Below is a tight, prioritized hunt plan — actionable test cases, tools/commands, and which findings map to the big payouts (P1/P2). No fluff, just the reconnaissance → exploitation path you can run tonight.

# Priorities (highest to lowest)

1. **Identity & SSO surfaces (identity.monash.edu, staff.monash, Okta integrations)** — _Highest ROI_. SSO/OIDC/SAML/Sessions often produce P1s (account takeover, org-wide token leakage).
    
2. **APIs (mix-*.monash.edu, fileshare.ze, any `*.apps.*`)** — _High ROI_. Broken auth/IDORs, object access, exposed endpoints → P1/P2.
    
3. **File share / cloud misconfig (fileshare.ze.monash.edu, S3/Google buckets)** — _High ROI_. Exposed data can be P1.
    
4. **Subdomain takeovers & DNS/CNAME leftovers (*.gp.monash.edu, apps subdomains)** — _High ROI and fast_.
    
5. **Host header / redirect / open-redirect / link injection** — _Medium ROI_. Can escalate to token theft or phishing (P2/P3).
    
6. **Request smuggling / desync (fronting proxies, old load balancers)** — _High complexity, high reward if successful_ (P1).
    
7. **File upload / deserialization / SSRF / RCE candidates (file upload endpoints, templating engines)** — _High reward but noisy & complex_.
    
8. **Mobile app auth flows (Monash Study apps, bSafe)** — _Moderate to high ROI_ if you find token misuse or API auth bugs.
    
9. **Classic web vulns for scale (XSS, CSRF, IDOR)** — _Lower per-find payout_ but worth for chaining and volume.
    

# Concrete test cases & vectors (actionable)

I’ll group by surface so you can systematically run through targets.

## 1) Identity / SSO / Okta / OIDC / SAML

- Test IdP metadata endpoints for **exposed client secrets, certs, login flows**.
    
- Test **IdP-initiated SSO** vs SP-initiated flows: attempt replay, parameter tampering (RelayState), missing audience checks.
    
- Look for **insecure token storage** or AWS/Google keys returned to frontends.
    
- Try **session fixation / cookie path/domain manipulation** (e.g., host header / cookie domain).
    
- Attempt **sso redirect / open-redirect chaining** to capture tokens or create convincing phishing redirect.
    
- Test **account linking** and forgot-password flows for logic bugs (race, reuse of tokens).  
    Why: an Okta/OIDC panic leads to P1 ATOs.
    

## 2) APIs (mix-*, fileshare, partner.apps)

- Enumerate API endpoints with `httpx` / Burp → check unauthenticated endpoints, verbose error messages.
    
- Test **IDOR**: object IDs, incremental IDs, guessing UUIDs, file IDs. Try access from different accounts or unauthenticated.
    
- Test **privilege escalation** via fields (isAdmin, role flags, price, owner_id).
    
- Fuzz endpoints for **mass assignment** (submit extra JSON keys like `is_admin:true`).
    
- Look for **insecure CORS**: origin wildcard + credentials → token theft.
    
- Check rate limits + brute force possibilities; look for logic abuse (mass API calls for business logic).  
    Why: IDOR or broken authorization → P1/P2.
    

## 3) File share & cloud storage

- Enumerate S3/GCS buckets for patterns: `fileshare.ze.monash.edu` → try `{bucket-name}.s3.amazonaws.com`, `/.well-known/`, `.env` exposures via `/.git` history.
    
- Try list/read via common misconfig paths and public-ACL checks.
    
- Search for public URLs that return tokens/credentials.  
    Why: Data dump / creds = P1.
    

## 4) Subdomain takeovers & DNS

- Check CNAME records pointing to unmanaged services (Heroku, Azure, GitHub Pages, Netlify).
    
- Run quick checks with `subzy` or `ctfr` (or your own CNAME lookups) for dangling CNAMEs.
    
- If takeover possible, host a proof that demonstrates control (simple HTML with unique text).  
    Why: Fast path to P1/P2 depending on impact.
    

## 5) Host header / redirect / SSRF / open-redirect

- Test host header injection: change `Host:` and see if app builds URLs, emails, or rewrites them. Use this to poison links in emails or cause internal requests.
    
- Test redirects for open-redirect chains; assess phishing impact.
    
- SSRF: test all URL fetchers, file previews, metadata fetchers (internal IPs, 169.254.169.254). Combine SSRF -> metadata -> RCE if present.  
    Why: Host header + SSRF chains escalate nicely.
    

## 6) Request Smuggling & Desync (advanced)

- Target reverse proxies or old frontends (nginx, old Apache). Attempt CL vs TE mismatches, ambiguous chunk terminators, zero-CL payloads.
    
- Focus on endpoints that proxy to internal admin consoles (identity endpoints).
    
- Practical POC: show request splitting that allows bypass of auth or gets access to admin endpoints.  
    Why: If you succeed, this can be P1 territory.
    

## 7) File upload / RCE / template injections

- Upload vector tests: content-type mismatches, double extension, null byte injection, image polyglot, EXIF payloads.
    
- Template injection in server templates (Handlebars, Mustache) — test template placeholders in user content.
    
- Deserialization: send crafted objects to endpoints expecting pickles/serialized payloads.  
    Why: RCE or sensitive data access → P1.
    

## 8) Mobile Apps

- Intercept API calls (Charles/mitmproxy) and test for weak auth, token reuse, insecure JWTs, plain tokens in logs.
    
- Check for local storage leakage of tokens, or debug endpoints exposing admin functions.  
    Why: Mobile → API weakness = P2/P1.
    

## 9) Classic web vuln hunting at scale

- XSS (stored/reflected) — look for stored XSS in templates, file names, comments. Chain to CSRF or token theft via CORS.
    
- CSRF on sensitive endpoints (profile/email change, payment).
    
- Insecure direct object refs (IDOR) on user resources.
    

# Tools & quick commands (run these)

- Subdomain discovery: `subfinder -d monash.edu -o subs.txt`
    
- Probe hosts/titles: `httpx -l subs.txt -status-code -title -threads 200 -o live.txt`
    
- Port + service scan (fast): `naabu -l live.txt -o ports.txt`
    
- Wayback + parameter discovery: `gau`, `waybackurls`, `fff`
    
- CORS check: `corsy` or `nuclei` cors templates
    
- S3 bucket check: `aws s3api list-buckets` (not applicable) — use `s3recon` and `s3scanner` patterns with guessed names.
    
- Request smuggling: Burp Pro + Smuggler extension or custom `curl` craft. Turbo Intruder for race conditions.  
    (You know the stack — pick the tools you prefer. These are the quick ones.)
    

# Mapping of findings → payouts (rough guide for prioritization)

- **Potential P1 (≈$2k–$10k)**: Org-wide ATO (Okta/OIDC misconfig), exposed tokens/credentials to cloud consoles, SSRF → metadata → creds, RCE on public app that accesses sensitive data, request smuggling enabling admin access, large data exposure from file shares.
    
- **Potential P2 (≈$1k–$2.5k)**: Significant IDORs, account takeover without lateral impact, broken auth on APIs exposing many user records, exploitable mobile API token leaks.
    
- **P3/P4**: XSS, CSRF, low-impact leaks and logic bugs. Useful for volume and chaining but not alone for $5k.
    

# Report & POC tips to maximize payout

- **Explain impact in Monash terms**: student data, exam data, identity systems, access to administrative functions. Connect the technical exploit to business impact.
    
- **Provide a clean, minimal reproducible POC**: curl + headers + exact sequence. Screenshot + HTTP logs + short video if practical.
    
- **Show exploitability & blast radius**: how many users affected, what data accessible, how an attacker would persist.
    
- **Suggest concise mitigations**: config changes, token rotation, CORS whitelists, proper auth checks. High quality writeups get faster triage and bigger discretionary payouts.
    

# Quick hunting roadmap for a single session (4 hours)

1. Reconfirm scope (Tier0/Tier1 first). Target `identity.monash.edu`, `staff.monash`, `mix-*.monash.edu`, `fileshare.ze.monash.edu`.
    
2. Run subfinder/httpx/wayback to build live endpoints. Triage by response type and frameworks (Okta/Java/Wordpress tags help).
    
3. Hit identity endpoints: test SSO flows, metadata, host header, redirect.
    
4. Enumerate APIs (mix-*) for unauth endpoints, run fuzz for IDOR (simple GUESS runs).
    
5. Check fileshare buckets and CORS quickly.
    
6. Do quick takeover/dns checks for dangling CNAMEs.
    
7. If above yields nothing, start desync attempts on proxies that reveal admin panels.
    
8. Always keep a detailed log (time, request, response, cookies) for the POC.
    

# Final micro-checklist (copy-paste)

-  IdP metadata & credentials leak (identity.*)
    
-  IdP / SAML/OIDC parameter tampering / IdP-initiated SSO tests
    
-  API IDOR / mass assignment / broken object ACLs (mix-_, apps._)
    
-  Public buckets / fileshare enumeration (fileshare.ze)
    
-  Host header & open-redirect tests on identity & staff endpoints
    
-  Subdomain takeover checks (_.gp.monash.edu, apps.connect._)
    
-  CORS with credentials + wildcard origin tests
    
-  SSRF to metadata endpoints from server-side fetchers
    
-  Request smuggling tests on fronting proxies
    
-  Mobile app API auth & token replay checks

You’re set. If you want, I’ll:

- convert that domain list into a single `httpx`-ready scope file and a `subfinder` command set, **or**
    
- generate a Burp/Turbo Intruder template for the fast IDOR/mass-assignment checks.
    

Which one now — scope file or Burp template?
