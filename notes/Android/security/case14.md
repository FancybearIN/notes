# **Improper Session Management**

ðŸ“Œ **Scenario**  
Apps create sessions using access tokens, refresh tokens, cookies, or device-bound session identifiers. Improper session management occurs when these artifacts are not expired, not invalidated on logout, stored insecurely, or lack proper server-side checks (replay protection, device binding, rotation). Result: an attacker who extracts the token (from storage, cache, backups, logs, or clipboard) can continue to use it long after the user logs outâ€”leading to account takeover, persistent data access, or privileged actions.

### **Detection**

1. **Static analysis**
    
    - Search code for session storage and lifecycle patterns:
        
        ```bash
        grep -R -n -E "putString\\(|putLong\\(|setCookie|CookieManager|SharedPreferences|getSharedPreferences|refresh_token|access_token|session" .
        ```
        
    - Look for missing logout flows or `clear()` calls: `prefs.edit().remove("token")` / `deleteDatabase()` / `EncryptedSharedPreferences` usage.
        
    - Check for code that treats logout purely as UI change (navigating to login screen) without server-side revoke calls.
        
2. **Dynamic analysis**
    
    - Login with test user; capture access & refresh tokens during auth (intercept or Frida).
        
    - Logout from app UI; do **not** delete captured token.
        
    - Attempt to reuse token (API with `Authorization` header) after logout:
        
        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" "https://api.target/user/me"
        ```
        
        - If token still valid â†’ improper session invalidation.
            
    - Check refresh behavior:
        
        - Use refresh token to mint new access token after logout. If refresh still works â†’ refresh tokens not revoked.
            
3. **Storage inspection**
    
    - Inspect SharedPreferences, DBs, files and backups to see where tokens persist post-logout:
        
        ```bash
        adb shell run-as com.example.app cat /data/data/com.example.app/shared_prefs/app_prefs.xml
        ```
        
    - Verify cookies in WebView/CookieManager remain after logout.
        
4. **Server-side behavior**
    
    - Observe token TTLs and revocation endpoints.
        
    - Test concurrent sessions: login on two devices, logout one, check whether session on other device invalidates.
        
5. **Runtime hooking**
    
    - Hook token-write calls to log where tokens are stored and whether delete calls happen on logout (stack traces help map omission).

### **Exploitation**

- **Token replay**
    
    - Use extracted access token to call APIs after victim logged out; if token is still valid, attacker retains access.
        
- **Refresh token abuse**
    
    - If refresh tokens are long-lived and not revoked on logout, attacker can mint fresh access tokens repeatedly.
        
- **Cookie reuse**
    
    - Extracted cookies reused in WebView or API clients bypass re-authentication.
        
- **Multi-device persistence**
    
    - If server lacks device binding, attacker with token can act from any device/location.
        
- **Privilege escalation via stale tokens**
    
    - Tokens issued with broad scopes/privileges remain usable; attacker can perform sensitive operations.
        
- **Persistence through backups/logs**
    
    - Tokens stored in backups or logs survive logout; attacker can extract them later.
        

Attacker vectors: local storage theft, backups, leaked logs, clipboard, malicious SDKs, device compromise.

### **Test cases / Practical checklist**

- Authenticate â†’ capture tokens (access + refresh).
    
- Logout via UI â†’ immediately:
    
    - Attempt API calls with access token.
        
    - Attempt refresh flow to mint new access token.
        
    - Inspect device storage for token remnants.
        
- Test server revocation:
    
    - Call logout endpoint, then check sessions list (if API exposes it) or call `GET /sessions`.
        
- Test token expiry:
    
    - Determine TTL by issuing token and calling until it expires (or inspect `exp` in JWT).
        
- Test device-binding:
    
    - Use stolen token from different IP/device â€” observe server checks (IP/device restrictions).
        
- Edge cases:
    
    - Test token reuse after password change or account disable (should invalidate tokens).
        
    - Test concurrent logout: logout one session and check others.

### **Detection signatures (grep / regex examples)**

```bash
# find likely token storage and logout functions
grep -R -nE "access[_-]?token|refresh[_-]?token|Authorization|logout|revoke|invalidate|clear\\(|remove\\(" .

# JWT pattern (to detect tokens in dumps/logs)
grep -oE "([A-Za-z0-9_-]+\.){2}[A-Za-z0-9_-]+" device-dump.txt

# Look for missing revoke calls (heuristic)
grep -R -n "logout" . | xargs -I{} sed -n '1,120p' {}
```

### **Real Bug Bounty Examples (what pays & why)**

- **Refresh tokens remain valid after logout** â†’ High/Critical (persistent takeover).
    
- **Access tokens valid until long TTL despite logout** â†’ High (session replay).
    
- **Tokens not invalidated after password change** â†’ High (failure to rotate/blacklist).
    
- **Multiple active sessions without user-visible control or server-side session listing** â†’ Mediumâ€“High (user cannot detect compromise).
    

Payouts reflect attacker effort vs blast radius: persistent tokens enabling full account access are high-impact.

---

### **Mitigation**

1. **Server-side session revocation**
    
    - On logout, call server revoke endpoint to invalidate refresh/access tokens (add token to revocation blacklist).
        
    - Implement centralized session store (`session_id`) server-side and mark sessions invalid on logout.
        
2. **Short TTLs + rotation**
    
    - Use short-lived access tokens and rotating refresh tokens; ensure refresh tokens rotate on use and old refresh tokens are invalidated.
        
3. **Bind tokens to device/context**
    
    - Tie tokens to device identifiers or per-device session IDs and validate on every request (with care for privacy).
        
    - Consider proof-of-possession tokens (mutual TLS or signed client assertions) for high-risk flows.
        
4. **Revoke on sensitive events**
    
    - Revoke tokens on password change, account recovery, suspicious activity, or when user explicitly requests session termination.
        
5. **Secure storage & deletion**
    
    - Store tokens securely (Keystore-wrapped, `EncryptedSharedPreferences`) and ensure logout clears persisted tokens reliably:
        
        ```java
        prefs.edit().remove("access_token").remove("refresh_token").apply();
        ```
        
    - Clear WebView cookies: `CookieManager.getInstance().removeAllCookies(null)`.
        
6. **Implement server-side session listings**
    
    - Allow users to view active sessions and remotely revoke them.
        
7. **Defensive logging & monitoring**
    
    - Monitor token reuse patterns, simultaneous use from different geolocations, and unusual refresh patterns â€” trigger revocation or MFA.
        
8. **Invalidate tokens after logout even if client fails**
    
    - Make logout a server-driven action: if client calls logout, server treats token as revoked regardless of client clearance.
        
9. **Graceful handling for offline clients**
    
    - For offline logouts, ensure server-side revocation occurs next time backend receives a logout signal (or provide push revocation).
        
10. **Avoid storing long-lived credentials**
    
    - Prefer ephemeral tokens; if refresh tokens are required, treat them as high-value secrets (encrypt, short TTL, rotate).
        
11. **Secure backup & logging**
    
    - Ensure backups & logs do not contain tokens; redact tokens in logs and exclude sensitive paths from backups.

### **Escalation paths & impact reasoning**

- **Persistent account takeover** â€” non-expiring/long-lived tokens allow long-term impersonation.
    
- **Lateral movement** â€” tokens with cross-service scopes enable broader compromise.
    
- **Silent persistence** â€” attacker maintains access even after user attempts remediation (logout), complicating detection.
    
- **Regulatory and financial damage** â€” if tokens enable transactions or expose PII.
    

Severity increases with token lifetime, scope, whether refresh tokens are abused, and lack of server-side revocation.

### **Exploitation notes & POC ideas (concise)**

- **POC A â€” Access token reuse after logout**
    
    1. Capture access token (intercept auth).
        
    2. Logout in-app.
        
    3. Immediately call protected endpoint with the captured token. If successful, document endpoint and returned data (redacted).
        
- **POC B â€” Refresh after logout**
    
    1. Capture refresh token.
        
    2. Logout in-app.
        
    3. Attempt refresh flow to obtain new access token. If successful, demonstrate access using new token.
        
- **POC C â€” Persistence after password change**
    
    1. Capture token.
        
    2. Change account password.
        
    3. Use token to access APIs â€” if still valid, shows tokens not rotated/revoked on credential change.
        
- **POC D â€” Cross-device reuse**
    
    1. Obtain token from device A.
        
    2. Use from device B / different IP. If server doesn't check device binding, access succeeds â€” demonstrate session hijack.
        

Always redact tokens in shared evidence; provide minimal repro steps required for triage.

âœ… **Summary**

- Improper session management (no revocation, long TTLs, insecure storage, no device binding) gives attackers small secrets that open big doors.
    
- Hunt by capturing tokens, logging out, and attempting reuse/refresh; check storage/backups and server-side revocation behavior.
    
- Fix by revoking sessions server-side on logout, using short TTLs with rotating refresh tokens, binding tokens to context, encrypting stored tokens, and giving users session visibility & control.
    

Session artifacts are tiny keys â€” treat them like crown jewels.
